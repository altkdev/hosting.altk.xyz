    <h3>How it Began</h3>

    <p>
      Hi, I am Owen, the original creator of ALTk. When i look at Altk I thought of it as a meme now i think of it as a comunity. Like everyone else in Altk Development, I really enjoy programming and making websites. I created ALTk in 6th grade. I started making websites for school projects in 5th grade and didn't think much about it. When I created ALTk, it was titled "class" as "hELLO.html" and you can still find it today. I knew I actually wanted it to be named ALTk because of the keyboard shortcut you had to press to activate the main attraction. ALTk wasn't even Apple or mobile compatible, and the only thing you could do was press Alt + K. From then on, it would redirect you to the actual YouTube video. I found out this was not really effective because it would show the title before the video loaded, and they knew what I was trying to do. When I realized Krish was good at coding, I asked him for help. Without him, ALTk wouldn't be how it is right now. i never thought of getting money from it but here we are with Altk Hosting.
